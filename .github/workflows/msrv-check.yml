# MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) Verification Workflow
#
# Purpose: Automatically verify that the MSRV declared in Cargo.toml is accurate
# Trigger: Only runs when Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, or this workflow file changes
# Strategy: Uses cargo-msrv tool to validate that code compiles with declared MSRV
#
# This workflow is part of the N-1 MSRV policy implementation:
# - Prevents accidental MSRV bumps through dependency updates
# - Acts as safety net when updating dependencies
# - Complements the main CI's MSRV testing (ci.yml)
